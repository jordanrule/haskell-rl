# Functional Reinforcement Learning in Haskell

I am implementing each chapter of [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) in Haskell.  The first iteration draws upon the work of [Monday Morning Haskell](https://mmhaskell.com/machine-learning) utilizing [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/haskell) and a second iteration will implement in a purely functional manner.

Inspiration is care of [Functional RL in Scala](https://github.com/sritchie/scala-rl).

## Getting Started

```
stack build
stack exec haskell-rl-exe
```
