# Functional Reinforcement Learning in Haskell

I am implementing each chapter of [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

Inspiration is care of [Reinforcement Learning in Scala](https://github.com/sritchie/scala-rl), with implementation guidance from [Haskell Open Gym](https://github.com/jhb563/OpenGymHs).

## Getting Started

```
stack build
stack exec chapter-one
```
