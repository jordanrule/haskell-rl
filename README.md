# Functional RL in Haskell

I am implementing each chapter of [Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) in [Haskell](https://github.com/haskell).  This is slow going, but progress will come steadily.

Inspiration is care of [Functional RL in Scala](https://github.com/sritchie/scala-rl).
